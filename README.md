## A few notes about my submission

I wrote a few notes on the design sketch that explains how I interpreted the design, which can be found here: https://github.com/puzzleForA0/puzzleForA0.github.io/blob/master/auth0_design_sketch.pdf.

The file format that I download from the Auth0 google drive was in PDF format, which made it difficult to extract exact design  element specifications from the file (e.g., font type, background images, etc.) or run it through a tool like Zeplin. I thought about trying to cut it up using photoshop (e.g., grabbing the logo, etc.) but I think the quality of the elements would have suffered in doing so, so I went ahead and used my own elements and I also estimated spacing & sizing for various elements on the site.
