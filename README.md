## A few notes about my submission

I wrote a few notes on the design sketch that explains how I interpreted the design, which can be found here: https://github.com/puzzleForAuth0/puzzleForAuth0.github.io/blob/master/auth0_design_sketch.pdf.

The file format that I download from the Auth0 google drive was in PDF format, which means I couldn't extract any design elements from the file (e.g., font type, sizes, background images, etc) or run it through a tool like Zeplin. I thought about trying to cut it up using photoshop (e.g., grabbing the logo, etc.) but I think the quality of the elements would have suffered in doing so, so I went ahead and used my own elements and I also estimated spacing & sizing for various elements on the site.
